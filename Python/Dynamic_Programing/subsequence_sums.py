"""
Given a sequence of integers named arr, find the number of continuous subsequences (sublist or subarray) in arr that sum up to s. A continuous subsequence can be defined as a sequence inbetween a start index and stop index (inclusive) of the sequence. For instance, [2, 3, 4] is a continuous subsequence of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , but [3, 5] and [4, 1] are not.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

The length of arr is â‰¤ 10,000. The contents of arr can range from -10000 to 10000.
