"""One man (lets call him Eulampy) has a collection of some almost identical FabergÃ© eggs. One day his friend Tempter said to him:

 Do you see that skyscraper? And can you tell me a maximal floor that if you drop your egg from will not crack it?
 No, - said Eulampy.
 But if you give me N eggs, - says Tempter - I'l tell you an answer.
 Deal - said Eulampy. But I have one requirement before we start this: if I will see more than M falls of egg, my heart will be crushed instead of egg. So you have only M trys to throw eggs. Would you tell me an exact floor with this limitation?
